My personal website!

This site is built using the static site generator [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) site generator (using the [v3.0.0 release](https://www.11ty.dev/blog/eleventy-v3/)). Built on top of [11ty/eleventy-base-blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog).

## Running Locally

```sh
npm install # Install dependencies with npm (https://www.npmjs.com)
npm run start # Starts a local development server (if you just want to build the site, you can use "npm run build")
```
